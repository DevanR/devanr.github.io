<h5 id="what-is-a-good-agreement">What is a good agreement?</h5>

<p>Fisher and Ury explain that a good agreement is one which is wise and
efficient, and which improves the parties’ relationship. Wise agreements
satisfy the parties’ interests and are fair and lasting.</p>

<h5 id="what-are-the-4-principles-of-principled-negotiation">What are the 4 principles of principled negotiation?</h5>

<ol>
  <li>separate the people from the problem</li>
  <li>focus on interests rather than positions</li>
  <li>generate a variety of options before settling on an agreement</li>
  <li>insist that the agreement be based on objective criteria</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="3-stages-to-the-negotiation-process">3 stages to the negotiation process:</h5>

<ol>
  <li>analysis of the situation or problem, of the other
parties’ interests and perceptions, and of the existing options</li>
  <li>plan ways of responding to the situation and the other parties</li>
  <li>the parties discuss the problem trying to find a solution on which they can
agree.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="separating-people-and-issues">Separating People and Issues</h5>

<p>Separating the people from the issues allows the parties to address the issues
without damaging their relationship. It also helps them to get a clearer view
of the substantive problem.</p>

<p>The parties should try to put themselves in the other’s place. The parties
should not simply assume that their worst fears will become the actions of the
other party. Nor should one side blame the other for the problem. Each side
should try to make proposals which would be appealing to the other side. The
more that the parties are involved in the process, the more likely they are to
be involved in and to support the outcome.</p>

<p>The first step in dealing with emotions is to acknowledge them, and to try to
understand their source. The parties must acknowledge the fact that certain
emotions are present, even when they don’t see those feelings as reasonable.
Dismissing another’s feelings as unreasonable is likely to provoke an even more
intense emotional response. The parties must allow the other side to express
their emotions. They must not react emotionally to emotional outbursts.
Symbolic gestures such as apologies or an expression of sympathy can help to
defuse strong emotions.</p>

<p>The parties should employ active listening. The listeners should give the
speaker their full attention, occasionally summarizing the speaker’s points to
confirm their understanding. It is important to remember that understanding the
other’s case does not mean agreeing with it. Speakers should direct their
speech toward the other parties and keep focused on what they are trying to
communicate. Each side should avoid blaming or attacking the other, and should
speak about themselves.</p>

<p>Generally the best way to deal with people problems is to prevent them from
arising. People problems are less likely to come up if the parties have a good
relationship, and think of each other as partners in negotiation rather than as
adversaries.</p>

<h5 id="focus-on-interests">Focus on Interests</h5>

<p>Good agreements focus on the parties’ interests, rather than their positions.
As Fisher and Ury explain, “Your position is something you have decided upon.
Your interests are what caused you to so decide.”[p. 42] Defining a problem in
terms of positions means that at least one party will “lose” the dispute. When
a problem is defined in terms of the parties’ underlying interests it is often
possible to find a solution which satisfies both parties’ interests.</p>

<p>The first step is to identify the parties’ interests regarding the issue at
hand. This can be done by asking why they hold the positions they do, and by
considering why they don’t hold some other possible position. Each party
usually has a number of different interests underlying their positions. And
interests may differ somewhat among the individual members of each side.
However, all people will share certain basic interests or needs, such as the
need for security and economic well-being.</p>

<p>Once the parties have identified their interests, they must discuss them
together. If a party wants the other side to take their interests into account,
that party must explain their interests clearly. The other side will be more
motivated to take those interests into account if the first party shows that
they are paying attention to the other side’s interests. Discussions should
look forward to the desired solution, rather than focusing on past events.
Parties should keep a clear focus on their interests, but remain open to
different proposals and positions.  Generate Options</p>

<p>Fisher and Ury identify four obstacles to generating creative options for
solving a problem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Parties may decide prematurely on an option and so fail to consider
alternatives</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parties may be intent on narrowing their options to find the single
answer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parties may define the problem in win-lose terms, assuming that the only
options are for one side to win and the other to lose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A party may decide that it is up to the other side to come up with a
solution to the problem.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The authors also suggest four techniques for overcoming these obstacles and
generating creative options. First it is important to separate the invention
process from the evaluation stage. The parties should come together in an
informal atmosphere and brainstorm for all possible solutions to the problem.
Wild and creative proposals are encouraged. Brainstorming sessions can be made
more creative and productive by encouraging the parties to shift between four
types of thinking: stating the problem, analyzing the problem, considering
general approaches, and considering specific actions. Parties may suggest
partial solutions to the problem. Only after a variety of proposals have been
made should the group turn to evaluating the ideas. Evaluation should start
with the most promising proposals. The parties may also refine and improve
proposals at this point.</p>

<p>Participants can avoid falling into a win-lose mentality by focusing on shared
interests. When the parties’ interests differ, they should seek options in
which those differences can be made compatible or even complementary. The key
to reconciling different interests is to “look for items that are of low cost
to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa.”[p. 79] Each side should try
to make proposals that are appealing to the other side, and that the other side
would find easy to agree to. To do this it is important to identify the
decision makers and target proposals directly toward them. Proposals are easier
to agree to when they seem legitimate, or when they are supported by precedent.
Threats are usually less effective at motivating agreement than are beneficial
offers.  Use Objective Criteria</p>

<p>When interests are directly opposed, the parties should use objective criteria
to resolve their differences. Allowing such differences to spark a battle of
wills will destroy relationships, is inefficient, and is not likely to produce
wise agreements. Decisions based on reasonable standards makes it easier for
the parties to agree and preserve their good relationship.</p>

<p>The first step is to develop objective criteria. Usually there are a number of
different criteria which could be used. The parties must agree which criteria
is best for their situation. Criteria should be both legitimate and practical.
Scientific findings, professional standards, or legal precedent are possible
sources of objective criteria. One way to test for objectivity is to ask if
both sides would agree to be bound by those standards. Rather than agreeing in
substantive criteria, the parties may create a fair procedure for resolving
their dispute. For example, children may fairly divide a piece of cake by
having one child cut it, and the other choose their piece.</p>

<p>There are three points to keep in mind when using objective criteria. First
each issue should be approached as a shared search for objective criteria. Ask
for the reasoning behind the other party’s suggestions. Using the other
parties’ reasoning to support your own position can be a powerful way to
negotiate. Second, each party must keep an open mind. They must be reasonable,
and be willing to reconsider their positions when there is reason to. Third,
while they should be reasonable, negotiators must never give in to pressure,
threats, or bribes. When the other party stubbornly refuses to be reasonable,
the first party may shift the discussion from a search for substantive criteria
to a search for procedural criteria.  When the Other Party Is More Powerful</p>

<p>No negotiation method can completely overcome differences in power. However,
Fisher and Ury suggest ways to protect the weaker party against a poor
agreement, and to help the weaker party make the most of their assets.</p>

<p>Often negotiators will establish a “bottom line” in an attempt to protect
themselves against a poor agreement. The bottom line is what the party
anticipates as the worst acceptable outcome. Negotiators decide in advance of
actual negotiations to reject any proposal below that line. Fisher and Ury
argue against using bottom lines. Because the bottom line figure is decided
upon in advance of discussions, the figure may be arbitrary or unrealistic.
Having already committed oneself to a rigid bottom line also inhibits
inventiveness in generating options.</p>

<p>Instead the weaker party should concentrate on assessing their best alternative
to a negotiated agreement (BATNA). The authors note that “the reason you
negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain
without negotiating.”[p. 104] The weaker party should reject agreements that
would leave them worse off than their BATNA. Without a clear idea of their
BATNA a party is simply negotiating blindly. The BATNA is also key to making
the most of existing assets. Power in a negotiation comes from the ability to
walk away from negotiations. Thus the party with the best BATNA is the more
powerful party in the negotiation. Generally, the weaker party can take
unilateral steps to improve their alternatives to negotiation. They must
identify potential opportunities and take steps to further develop those
opportunities. The weaker party will have a better understanding of the
negotiation context if they also try to estimate the other side’s BATNA. Fisher
and Ury conclude that “developing your BATNA thus not only enables you to
determine what is a minimally acceptable agreement, it will probably raise that
minimum.”[p. 111] When the Other Party Won’t Use Principled Negotiation</p>

<p>Sometimes the other side refuses to budge from their positions, makes personal
attacks, seeks only to maximize their own gains, and generally refuses to
partake in principled negotiations. Fisher and Ury describe three approaches
for dealing with opponents who are stuck in positional bargaining. First, one
side may simply continue to use the principled approach. The authors point out
that this approach is often contagious.</p>

<p>Second, the principled party may use “negotiation jujitsu” to bring the other
party in line. The key is to refuse to respond in kind to their positional
bargaining. When the other side attacks, the principles party should not
counter attack, but should deflect the attack back onto the problem. Positional
bargainers usually attack either by asserting their position, or by attacking
the other side’s ideas or people. When they assert their position, respond by
asking for the reasons behind that position. When they attack the other side’s
ideas, the principle party should take it as constructive criticism and invite
further feedback and advice. Personal attacks should be recast as attacks on
the problem. Generally the principled party should use questions and strategic
silences to draw the other party out.</p>

<p>When the other party remains stuck in positional bargaining, the one-text
approach may be used. In this approach a third party is brought in. The third
party should interview each side separately to determine what their underlying
interests are. The third party then assembles a list of their interests and
asks each side for their comments and criticisms of the list. She then takes
those comments and draws up a proposal. The proposal is given to the parties
for comments, redrafted, and returned again for more comments. This process
continues until the third party feels that no further improvements can be made.
At that point, the parties must decide whether to accept the refined proposal
or to abandon negotiations.  When the Other Party Uses Dirty Tricks</p>

<p>Sometimes parties will use unethical or unpleasant tricks in an attempt to gain
an advantage in negotiations such as good guy/bad guy routines, uncomfortable
seating, and leaks to the media. The best way to respond to such tricky tactics
is to explicitly raise the issue in negotiations, and to engage in principled
negotiation to establish procedural ground rules for the negotiation.</p>

<p>Fisher and Ury identify the general types of tricky tactics. Parties may engage
in deliberate deception about the facts, their authority, or their intentions.
The best way to protect against being deceived is to seek verification the
other side’s claims. It may help to ask them for further clarification of a
claim, or to put the claim in writing. However, in doing this it is very
important not to bee seen as calling the other party a liar; that is, as making
a personal attack. Another common type of tactic is psychological warfare. When
the tricky party uses a stressful environment, the principled party should
identify the problematic element and suggest a more comfortable or fair change.
Subtle personal attacks can be made less effective simply be recognizing them
for what they are. Explicitly identifying them to the offending party will
often put an end to suck attacks. Threats are a way to apply psychological
pressure. The principled negotiator should ignore them where possible, or
undertake principled negotiations on the use of threats in the proceedings.</p>

<p>The last class of trick tactics are positional pressure tactics which attempt
to structure negotiations so that only one side can make concessions. The
tricky side may refuse to negotiate, hoping to use their entry into
negotiations as a bargaining chip, or they may open with extreme demands. The
principled negotiator should recognize this as a bargaining tactic, and look
into their interests in refusing to negotiate. They may escalate their demands
for every concession they make. The principled negotiator should explicitly
identify this tactic to the participants, and give the parties a chance to
consider whether they want to continue negotiations under such conditions.
Parties may try to make irrevocable commitments to certain positions, or to
make-take-it-or-leave-it offers. The principled party may decline to recognize
the commitment or the finality of the offer, instead treating them as proposals
or expressed interests. Insist that any proposals be evaluated on their merits,
and don’t hesitate to point out dirty tricks.</p>
