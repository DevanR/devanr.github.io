I completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering in Singapore.  I then pursued
a PhD in Computer Science at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. I have a
wide variety of interests.  I'm currently interested in the Machine Learning,
Simulations and Complexity. I'm also open to contract and freelance work.
