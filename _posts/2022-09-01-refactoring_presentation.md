I recently had the opportunity to give a presentation at a company Lunch and
Learn. I chose a topic that was close to my heart. Since I discovered Test
Driven Development (TDD) as a junior engineer, its been one of the the main
tools I use to create value while developing.

This Presentation touches on the "Why" of TDD. The muddy waters of tests and
integrated tests. And finally, how we can attempt to refactoy legacy codebases.

You can download a PDF of the slides [here](/assets/pdf/tdd.pdf).
