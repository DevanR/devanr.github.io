<p>I recently had the opportunity to give a presentation at a company Lunch and
Learn. I chose a topic that was close to my heart. Since I discovered Test
Driven Development (TDD) as a junior engineer, its been one of the the main
tools I use to create value while developing.</p>

<p>This Presentation touches on the “Why” of TDD. The muddy waters of tests and
integrated tests. And finally, how we can attempt to refactoy legacy codebases.</p>

<p>You can download a PDF of the slides <a href="/assets/pdf/tdd.pdf">here</a>.</p>
