<p>This book was recommended in a post on HackerNews. As someone who has
always been fascinated with multiple subjects, it’s always seemed like
a curse. Always finding new things to learn and experiment but never
having sufficient time to do to. The premise of this book, is that,
that are other people out there like me, and the term coined here is
“Scanner”. Discovering this term made this book worth it for me.</p>

<p>Embrace the joys of learning, however long or brief that they may be.
Give yourself completely to the process and trust your own instincts.
Commit to everything that interests you.</p>

<p>Actively analyse what interests you and investigate that interest with
short projects. Use the feedback from these projects to decide whether
to invest for time. Action and feedback, rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Start small, start now. Start everything, don’t worry about finishing.</p>

<p>I’m care primarily about my surroundings and the people I work with.
Happiness is more important than success for me. I’ve learned that
the most important career question is, “Will this make me happy?”.</p>

<p>And whatever position I’m in, I’m the happiest when I’m providing the
best value, ie, being the most valuable player.</p>
