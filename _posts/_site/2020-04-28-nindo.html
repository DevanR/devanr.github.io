<p>Here is my current collection of useful tools and models.  This is to serve a
reminder and guide to myself and possibly a guide to others.</p>

<h4 id="body">Body</h4>

<p>The objective here is to maximise energy levels.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimal sugar</li>
  <li>Stay hydrated</li>
  <li>Stretch/Yoga breaks</li>
  <li>Daily cardio</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mind">Mind</h4>

<p>The Objective here manage your daily state.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Being mindful throughout the day</li>
  <li>Practice empathy and kindness to all</li>
  <li>Having a vision</li>
  <li>Keeping a daily journal</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

<p>I used to have specific tools that I used. But now, I’m a little more agnostic.
The litmus test for me is to use any tool that is a force multiplier.</p>

<h4 id="processes">Processes</h4>

<p>The first round is probably going to be wrong. Get the first version out and
use the right metrics for succes from day one. If it’s revenue, let that guide
you.</p>

<h4 id="useful-books">Useful Books</h4>

<p>I will always be a voracious reader of books. But these days, I have to temper
my enthusiasm to learn with a decent measure of practice. In some matters,
experience does indeed trump knowledge and I am slowly trying to discern the
line between the two.</p>

<p>So my advice here is to read as much as you can, but remember to practice what
you read to find out what works best for you.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>Know what you want and fail your way to success.</p>
