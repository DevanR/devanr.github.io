<p>I was inspired by a colleague of mine to do some experimenting with
electronics. After some thought, I decided to build a mechanical keyboard. It
is reasonably straight-forward and seemed like a good project to cut my teeth
on. This article is a brief overview of how I went about doing it.</p>

<p>A basic keyboard is made up of a micro-controller, switches and some means of
communicating with a computer (usually USB). The firmware on the
microcontroller, translates the key presses into the appropriate keycodes
which are received by the computer.</p>

<p>My goal was to keep things as simple and inexpensive as possible. I chose a
minimalistic design and a 40 key footprint. I was also wanted to make as much
from scratch as possible. (While it is possible to cast you own key caps, but
that was going too far down the rabbit hole for me!) The goal was to build a
keyboard that I would use everyday.</p>

<p>Once I understand how it worked <a href="http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/">1</a>, I set about designing and sourcing the
parts. Here is a brief description of the components I used.</p>

<h5 id="micro-controller">Micro-controller</h5>

<p>I used the Pro Micro 5V/16MHz ATMega 32U4 Module <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide">2</a> as seemed to be the most
affordable. Its datasheet can be found here <a href="http://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Dev/Arduino/Boards/Pro-Micro-v11-5V_B.pdf">3</a>. I bought these from Ebay.</p>

<h5 id="diodes">Diodes</h5>

<p>I used the 1N4148 Diodes, which I purchased from Amazon.</p>

<h5 id="switches">Switches</h5>

<p>I decided to go with Gateron Brown Switches from Massdrop. I would have
preferred the standard Cherry MX switches, but none were available at the time.
These were tactile with an average activation force.</p>

<h5 id="pcb">PCB</h5>

<p>Initially, I designed my PCB with Eagle <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">4</a>. It was only later in the design
process that I discovered that the size provided in the free version was too
small. I switched to KiCAD <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">5</a>, which looking back I should have used in the
first place. Its open source, free and has a large community. Overall a very
nice piece of software. I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Once designed I had the PCB made in China. While I speak Mandaring, I had a
friend who happened to be in China source out a manufacturer and had everything
shipped to him. He then brought it to UK for me when he returned from his
travels. One thing to note, is that the minimum order in my case was 10 pieces.</p>

<h5 id="firmware">Firmware</h5>

<p>One of the decisions that influenced my choice of micro-controller was the
keyboard firmware that it supported. The tmk_keyboard firmware <a href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard">6</a> is available
for the Pro Micro and it has a large community. It has a number for nice
feature, including the support of various micro-controllers, a in-built
layering system, good documentation and it was still being actively developed.
In this case I stood on the shoulders of giants. I relied heavily on the kind
folks at deskthority to get the right information to hook everything up
correctly <a href="https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/how-to-build-your-very-own-keyboard-firmware-t7177.html#p141386">7</a>, <a href="https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/all-about-custom-keyboard-controllers-t2340.html">8</a> and <a href="https://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/how-to-use-a-pro-micro-as-a-cheap-controller-converter-like-soarer-s-t8448.html">9</a>.</p>

<h6 id="keycaps">Keycaps</h6>

<p>I used blank Ortholinear DSA PBT keycaps online <a href="http://pimpmykeyboard.com/">10</a> (ErgoDox base set). While
the custom sets are beautiful, I wanted to be able to touch type, so having
them blank seemed appropriate. Also, I could not justify the price.</p>

<h5 id="layout">Layout</h5>

<p>I used an amazing online keyboard layout tool <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/">11</a> to design and spec out my
layout. I decided to go minimalist and see how far I could go with as little
keys as possible. I eventually settled with a 40 key layout, with two
additional functional layers.</p>

<h5 id="case">Case</h5>

<p>I came across a Case and Plate building tool <a href="http://builder.swillkb.com/">12</a>, which accepts keyboard
layouts as inputs and returns SVG schematics for the switch plate and
corresponding case. These have to be converted into STL. Thankfully, there is a
youtube video <a href="https://youtu.be/8CROo67W24M?list=LL-4okkubPyyCkBs9PqysCdwa">13</a> that shows how this can be done with FreeCAD <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">14</a>. I had the
case laser cut from Acrylic in China. Like the PCB, the minimum order was 10.</p>

<p><img src="/images/keyboard/case.jpg" alt="PCB" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<h5 id="screws">Screws</h5>

<p>I went with a 5mm round head bolt and nut to screw the case together. This was
purchased from Amazon.</p>

<h5 id="tools">Tools</h5>

<p>Seeing as I had never done this before, I had to get the tools to assemble
everything. Here is the bare minimum tools that you would need to get the job
done.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Soldering iron</li>
  <li>Solder</li>
  <li>Solder sucker</li>
  <li>Flush Flathead craft pliers</li>
  <li>Flat head screwdriver</li>
  <li>Multimeter</li>
  <li>Tweezers</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>

<p>Here the final complete keyboard:</p>

<p><img src="/images/keyboard/front.jpg" alt="Keyboard front" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/images/keyboard/back.jpg" alt="Keyboard back" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Break down of the cost of materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10x (Case and PCB) -&gt; £80   (£8 each)</li>
  <li>100x diodes        -&gt; £1.70 (£0.68 for 40)</li>
  <li>120x switches      -&gt; £31   (£10 for 40)</li>
  <li>120x keycaps       -&gt; £62   (£20 for 40)</li>
  <li>1x Microcontroller -&gt; £2.5  (£2.5 each)</li>
  <li>1x USB cable       -&gt; £1.4  (£1.4 each)</li>
</ul>

<p>So it works out to about £43 per complete keyboard. It is now my main keyboard
at work. Performance wise, it’s taking awhile to get used to the multiple
keyboard layers and the switches are a bit lighter to the touch than what I’m
used to. Also, the I’ve realised that the mini-USB connection on the
micro-controller is the weakest point of the build. I’ve already managed to
break it once, so constantly removing the cable is not really an option.
Thankfully, I can leave it on when I store it.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot about electronics and making for this project. It’s really
opened my eyes in terms of what is possible with the Internet and the low price
of electronic parts available online. I’ve replaced the resistors of my Samsung
TV and fixed the broken switch of my bicycle lights with my new found skills.
It’s amazing what one can do with a soldering iron and a multi-meter! Overall,
I’m glad I did this project.</p>

<p>For anyone thinking of building their own keyboard, I would highly recommend it
and there are a ton of useful resources available here <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=69582.0">15</a> to get you started.</p>
